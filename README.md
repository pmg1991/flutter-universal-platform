Currently, if you include the _dart.io.Platform_ anywhere in your code, your app will throw the following error on Web:

```
Unsupported operation: Platform._operatingSystem
```

With this plugin you can perform platform detection on all platforms, including Web, without errors.

## üî® Installation

```yaml
dependencies:
  universal_platform: ^0.1.3
```

### ‚öô Import

Remove any usages of _dart.io.Platform_, and replace with this:

```dart
import 'package:universal_platform/universal_platform.dart';
```

## üïπÔ∏è Usage

This acts as a drop-in replacement for dart.io.Platform, with a different name for improved clarity.

```dart
//This will explode on Web
bool isIos = Platform.isIOS;

//This will not :)
bool isIos = UniversalPlatform.isIOS;
bool isWeb = UniversalPlatform.isWeb;
```

## üß™ Testing

In tests, it's possible to override the current platform to test for different paths of behavior in your production code. You can do so by setting the `overrideTestValue` to your desired platform.

```dart
test('isMobile function works properly', () {
  // Set the override value to simulate a platform.
  UniversalPlatform.overrideTestValue = UniversalPlatformType.MacOS;
  // Don't forget to reset the override value when done.
  addTearDown(UniversalPlatform.clearOverrideTestValue);

  expect(isMobile(), isFalse); // ‚úÖ

  UniversalPlatform.overrideTestValue = UniversalPlatformType.IOS;

  expect(isMobile(), isTrue); // ‚úÖ
});
```
